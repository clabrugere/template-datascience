# Template datascience

A simple template for datascience python projects using cookiecutter.

## Usage

Navigate to a directory of your choice and execute the command:

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/clabrugere/template-datascience
```

This will create the project structure in the current working directory:
- ```data/``` contains all the data files used by the project:
	- ```data/raw/``` the original data dumps
	- ```data/iterim/``` the itermediate datasets that are expensive to generate
	- ```data/processed/``` the final canonical datasets for modeling
	- ```data/results/``` results generated by the models
- ```notebooks/``` contains all the development and presentation notebooks. They can be named using a standard convention such as ```<step #>-<step name>-<task name>.ipynb```, for example ```01-EDA-Data_quality.ipynb```
- ```reports/``` contains the generated reports and figures
- ```src/``` contains all the core code:
	- ```src/data``` code to fetch or generate the raw and interim datasets
	- ```src/features``` code to generate the final canonical datasets
	- ```src/models``` code implementing the models
